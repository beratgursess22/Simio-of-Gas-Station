Fuel Station Simulation Project ‚Äì Full Detailed Description

--Project Title: Discrete-Event Simulation of a Fuel Station

--Simulation Tool: Simio

1. üìå Problem Overview and Objectives
   
This project models a high-traffic fuel station in Kaƒüƒ±thane, ƒ∞stanbul, which serves approximately 600 vehicles daily. Main issues observed in the real system include:

--Long queues and customer waiting times

--Uneven utilization of fuel pumps and cashier

--Delays in payment processing


--Limited number of staff and station space

üéØ Project Goal:

Serve at least 85% of customers within 7 minutes, using no more than 8 staff members.

The simulation is built to evaluate:

--System efficiency

--Congestion levels

--Resource allocation strategies

The model includes realistic vehicle arrival patterns, fuel-based routing, secondary resource constraints (pump attendants), and behaviors such as balking (leaving due to long queues).

2. üß± System and Conceptual Model
We built the conceptual model based on direct field observations and interviews. Key components:

Vehicle types:

--Gasoline/Diesel (78%)

--LPG (20%)

--Electric (2%)

Routing:
Vehicles are assigned to fuel types using Table Routing with three node lists: Nodelist_benzin_or_diesel, Nodelist_gas, and Nodelist_elec.

Separator-Combiner Logic:
Drivers separate from their vehicles after arrival. 50% walk to the cashier, others wait near their cars. Numerical weights (ModelEntity.path_no) control driver-path matching for return.

Queuing Discipline:
FIFO with infinite queue capacities.

3. ‚öôÔ∏è Simulation Model Implementation (Simio)

Vehicles arrive following a Poisson process (Lognormal interarrival times).

Each vehicle has Fuel Type and Payment Method as state variables.

Fuel pumps require a secondary resource (attendant) to operate.

The cashier has 3-shift coverage but is modeled as a single server.

Logic includes:

--Balking behavior

--Routing based on vehicle type

--Status Labels (e.g., Number of Entities, Balked Vehicles)

--Step-run and Breakpoint debugging

4. ‚úÖ Verification of the Model
The Simio simulation outputs were compared to analytical queueing theory calculations for each service point (gas, benzin, electric, cashier).

-Utilization (œÅ), queue length (Lq), and waiting time (Wq) values were closely aligned for the cashier and overall system.

-Discrepancies in gas and electric points were attributed to:

--High variability in arrival/service times

--Server assignment randomness

--Modeling simplifications (e.g., ignoring license plate recognition)

Conclusion: Model is partially verified but falls within acceptable tolerance.

5. üìä Input Data Collection and Modelling
-100 samples collected between 10:00‚Äì13:00 for:

--Interarrival time

--Service times for benzin, gas, electric, cashier

--Fuel types and payment methods

Distributions used (p > 0.05 for all):

--Interarrival: Lognormal(Œº = 2.3277, œÉ = 0.9885)

--Benzin: Beta(Œ±‚ÇÅ = 0.04448, Œ±‚ÇÇ = 1.4484)

--Gas: Normal(Œº = 87.735, œÉ = 32.098)

--Cashier: Gamma(107.02, 0.79198)

--Electric: Lognormal(Œº = 0.1569, œÉ = 7.8448)

8. üîÅ Alternative Scenario Analysis

Five scenarios were tested by changing:

-Service times

-Number of pumps or cashier capacity

-Staff allocation

üîç Results:

Scenario 1: Best across all performance KPIs (but high variability)

Scenario 2: Balanced and stable

Scenario 5: Most efficient in electric/gas queues

Scenario 3: High profit, but system congestion

Scenario 4: Underperforming in queues and utilization
